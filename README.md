# 🧠 NeuroPlayUX

**Adaptive Human–Computer Interaction powered by Artificial Intelligence**

NeuroPlayUX is an applied research project that integrates **machine learning** into **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** to create intelligent, adaptive user experiences.  
The system observes **player behavior**, learns from their **interaction patterns**, and predicts an **optimal challenge level** in real time — enhancing usability, engagement, and cognitive flow.

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores how **AI-driven behavioral analysis** can personalize game difficulty and user interfaces based on real-time data.  
By merging **UX principles**, **data modeling**, and **predictive algorithms**, NeuroPlayUX demonstrates how modern systems can adapt dynamically to each user’s performance.

**Core Goals:**
- Learn player patterns from input and performance data.
- Predict appropriate difficulty or challenge levels.
- Adjust interaction design based on cognitive load and behavior.
- Validate the adaptive model through usability and response metrics.

## 🧩 Architecture

NeuroPlayUX is structured in three core layers:

1. **User Interaction Layer**  
   - Front-end interface for game/interaction design.  
   - Captures input events, actions, and performance metrics.

2. **Cognitive Analysis Engine**  
   - Processes user data in real time.  
   - Applies trained machine learning models to detect skill trends.  
   - Predicts and recommends the next appropriate difficulty level.

3. **Adaptive Feedback Module**  
   - Dynamically modifies UI/UX or game parameters.  
   - Aims to maintain user engagement and flow state.

## 🧠 AI & Learning Logic

The adaptive model is trained using player behavior datasets (e.g., time to task completion, accuracy, error rates).  
Techniques include:
- **Supervised learning** (classification of player skill levels).  
- **Reinforcement heuristics** for real-time difficulty adjustment.  
- **Feature extraction** from gameplay logs and interaction data.

This enables **predictive adaptation**, where the interface learns and evolves with each user session.
